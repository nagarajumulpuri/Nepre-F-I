**Nepre/iNepre -- CodePackage**

**Introduction** \
iNepre is a scoring function for calculating the protein's potential energy using interfacial residues. And it will help to predict the 3D structure of a protein complexes. 

**Nepre** (Folder Nepre) \
Calculate the potential energy using fixed cutoff (Nepre).
Users can use the neighborhood residue distance cutoff between **4** angstrom and **10** angstroms to calculate the potential energy (distance cutoff=**6**A is recommended).

**iNepre**  (Folder iNepre) \
Calculate the potential energy using fixed cutoff (iNepre).
Users can use the neighborhood residue distance cutoff between **4** angstrom and **10** angstroms to calculate the potential energy (distance cutoff=**6**A is recommended) and interfacial residue distance cutoff between **4** angstrom and **6** angstrom to define interfacial residues (distance cutoff=**6**A is recommended).

**Installation** \
The Nepre/iNepre is implemented with Python 3.7.3 and the installation is straightforward. It can be downloaded and executed if numpy and biopython modules are installed in the python environment.

The required package is **numpy** and **biopython.**

The usage for Nepre/iNepre can be found in the corresponding folders.
