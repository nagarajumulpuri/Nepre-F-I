**NEPRE-F/I -- CodePackage**

**Introduction**
Nepre-I is a scoring function for calculating the protein's potential energy using interfacial residues. And it will help to predict the 3D structure of a protein complexes. 

**Nepre-F**
Calculate the potential energy using fixed cutoff (Nepre-F).
Users can use the neighborhood residue distance cutoff between 4 angstrom and 10 angstroms to calculate the potential energy (distance cutoff=6A is recommended).

**Nepre-I**
Calculate the potential energy using fixed cutoff (Nepre-I).
Users can use the neighborhood residue distance cutoff between 4 angstrom and 10 angstroms to calculate the potential energy (distance cutoff=6A is recommended) and interfacial residue distance cutoff between 4 angstrom and 6 angstrom to define interfacial residues (distance cutoff=6A is recommended).

**Installation**
The Nepre-F/I is implemented with Python 3.7.3 and the installation is straightforward. It can be downloaded and executed if numpy and biopython modules are installed in the python environment.

The required package is **numpy** and **biopython.**

The usage for Nepre-F/I can be found in the corresponding folders (Cutoff).
